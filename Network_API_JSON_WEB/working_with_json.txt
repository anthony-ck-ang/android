1. Firstly, Validate json data or url at jsonlint.com
e.g.
https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=android,nougat&format=json$nojsoncallback=1

2. For the steps, refer to GetRawData.java


Convert raw data to Java objects

ETL (Extract + transform)

1. Take note of the keys in the json that you want to extract and save in objects
(excluding images as mobile devices have limited memory (heap))
images will only be downloaded before displaying on screen
